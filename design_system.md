Design System: Constructivist Logistics (Bauhaus Style)

Philosophy: "Less is More." The UI should function like a well-organized warehouse shelf. Distinct lines, clear labels, and bold signals.

1. Typography

We rely on fonts that mimic 20th-century poster design—geometric and industrial.

Headings: Syne (Extra Bold). Unapologetic, quirky, and distinct.

Usage: Page Titles, Key Metrics (e.g., "80 KG").

Body / Data: Space Grotesk or DM Sans. Monospace-like readability for data.

Usage: Lists, inventory tables, button text.

2. Color Palette (The Bauhaus Triad)

We strictly avoid pastels. Colors denote status with high contrast.

Canvas (Background): #F4F3EE (Warm Off-White/Newsprint). Never pure #FFFFFF.

Structure (Ink): #121212 (Near Black). Used for all borders and primary text.

Action (International Orange): #FF4F00.

Usage: Primary Buttons, "Urgent", "Expiring Now".

Logistics (Klein Blue): #002FA7.

Usage: Navigation, Routing lines, Headers.

Data/Warning (Signal Yellow): #FFD700.

Usage: Highlights, secondary alerts, "Nutri-Score C".

Stability (Geometric Green): #008055.

Usage: "Fresh", "Eco-Score A", Success states.

3. UI Components & "The Grid"

The Container (The Box)

Border: 2px Solid Black (border-2 border-black).

Radius: 0px (Sharp edges).

Shadow: Hard offset shadow, no blur. (box-shadow: 5px 5px 0px 0px #000).

Why? It feels tangible, like a physical box of food.

The Button

Style: Rectangular. High contrast.

Interaction: On hover, the button moves down into its shadow (tactile feel).

Label: Uppercase, tracking-wide.

The Visuals

Icons: No filled, soft icons. Use thin-line geometric icons or ASCII-style symbols.

Images: Treated with a grayscale filter or placed inside a distinct circular or square frame.

4. View-Specific Rules

Donor (Marketplace)

Layout: Masonry or Asymmetric Grid.

Urgency: Indicated by a solid geometric shape (e.g., a red circle) overlaying the content.

Volunteer (Route)

Metaphor: The Transit Map.

Lines: Thick, connecting nodes.

Checkboxes: Large, empty squares that fill with a solid "X" or block color.

Charity (Inventory)

Metaphor: The Ledger.

Table: Distinct vertical and horizontal black lines separating every cell (Mondrian-style grid).

Modal: A "Blueprint" overlay. White background, thick borders, technical data presentation.
