Design System: Neo-Bauhaus (Soft Geometry)

Philosophy: "Playful Functionality." We use geometric primitives (circles, arches, squares) to organize content, but with a softer, friendlier touch suited for community volunteering.

1. Color Palette (Lighter Contrast)

We move away from stark Black/White to deep Greys and soft geometric fills.

Canvas: #FFFFFF (Pure White) or #F8FAFC (Very light cool grey).

Ink (Text): #1E293B (Slate 800) - Softer than black.

Primary (Community Blue): #4F46E5 (Indigo/Blue) - Used for major actions/headers. Refers to the "Untitled UI" reference.

Accent A (Active Orange): #FB923C (Soft Orange) - Used for urgency/action.

Accent B (Geometric Red): #F43F5E (Rose) - Used for alerts/stops.

Accent C (Stability Teal): #2DD4BF (Teal) - Used for success/freshness.

Shapes/Fills: Low opacity versions of the above colors (e.g., bg-indigo-50) to define areas without borders.

2. Typography

Headings: Outfit or Syne. Geometric but legible.

Body: DM Sans. Friendly, rounded sans-serif.

3. UI Components (Rounded & Borderless)

The Container (The Tile)

Border: None (or very subtle border-slate-100).

Radius: rounded-2xl or rounded-3xl. Large, friendly curves.

Shadow: Soft, diffuse shadows (shadow-lg with low opacity). No hard edges.

The Button

Style: Pill shape (rounded-full).

Hover: subtle lift (translate-y-[-2px]) and shadow bloom.

Geometric Motifs (The "Bauhaus" Touch)

Use Quarter Circles and Semi-Circles as background decorations or to frame images.

Grids: Layouts should feel like a tiled masonry grid.

4. View-Specific Updates

Donor View

Cards: White cards floating on a soft grey background.

Images: Clipped into geometric shapes (e.g., an image inside a circle or arch).

Volunteer View

Route Line: A thick, rounded path connecting circular nodes.

Map: Desaturated, clean map with bright geometric pins.

Charity Dashboard

Table: "Zebra striping" replaced by floating rows with rounded corners.

Modal: Clean, white floating sheet with a colorful geometric header.
